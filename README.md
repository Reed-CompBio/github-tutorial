# github-tutorial
This repository aims to give you more experience with working collaboratively as developeres in a repository. In this tutorial we will do the following things:
- Create a new branch and make changes by adding a file
- Within your branch, create a pull request where someone will review your code to see if it looks good.
- Merge your branch back into main
- Once everyone's changes are in main, we want to merge all the individual branches with the changesmain 
- Pair up with someone and each of you will edit the same line of code in the same file (in your own respective branches), simulating a merge conflict.
- One person will have to make a pull request to main but the other person will have to fix the merge conflict

## 1. Creating a branch
When you want to make changes to a repository, it is best practice to make a new branch from main.
